# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
#If you need to add more default categories later, you can append them to the seed file and reload it.
#If you want to rerun the seed data, the trick is that the seeds file doesnâ€™t know whether the records
#already in the database have to be cleaned up; running rake db:seed again adds all records one more
#time, and you end up with duplicate user and categories. You should instead call rake db:setup, which
#re-creates the database and adds the seed data as you may expect.
