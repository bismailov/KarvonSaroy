By age 3, children whose parents were professionals had vocabularies of about 1,100 words, and children whose parents were on welfare had vocabularies of about 525 words.

Reading Bear introduces and explains, in a way accessible even to three-year-olds, over 1,200 basic vocabulary items. Repeated viewings of each presentation will go a long way to imparting much of the sort of basic vocabulary that children of professionals have mastered. So those of us behind Reading Bear feel very comfortable in saying that our resource helps develop not only decoding skills but also the sort of basic vocabulary that is so essential to learning to read.

One often overlooked advantage of teaching to very young children is that they are not intimidated by reading. They don't know that it's supposed to be hard. If you proceed at the child's pace rather than at a pace you pre-determined for him or her, if you treat it as a game, and if you take breaks when and for as long as needed, then your little student will have fun and learn much more than you might have thought possible.
